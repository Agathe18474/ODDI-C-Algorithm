Graph analysis: 
    
- Graph Properties
    Creates a random graph and assesses its robustness properties as per the definition defined by LeBlanc in his (2013) paper. 

    Create_graph creates random static "satellites" around an Earth-like sphere. Satellites are positioned randomly with different Keplerian Elements.
    Distance between nodes is assessed and the k-nearest neighbours are selected to connect with the satellite. Resulting graph is then analysed for its    robustness.
